NAME
    `Tickit::Widget::Menu' - display a menu of choices

SYNOPSIS
     use Tickit;
     use Tickit::Widget::Menu;

     my $tickit = Tickit->new;

     my $menu = Tickit::Widget::Menu->new(
        items => [
           Tickit::Widget::Menu::Item->new(
              name => "Exit",
              on_activate => sub { $tickit->stop }
           ),
        ],
     );

     $menu->popup( $tickit->rootwin, 5, 5 );

     $tickit->run;

DESCRIPTION
    This widget class acts as a display container for a list of items
    representing individual choices. It can be displayed as a floating
    window using the `popup' method, or attached to a
    Tickit::Widget::MenuBar or as a child menu within another
    `Tickit::Widget::Menu'.

    This widget is intended to be displayed transiently, either as a pop-up
    menu over some other widget, or as a child menu of another menu or an
    instance of a menu bar. Specifically, such objects should not be
    directly added to container widgets.

STYLE
    The default style pen is used as the widget pen. The following style pen
    prefixes are also used:

    highlight => PEN
        The pen used to highlight the active menu selection

CONSTRUCTOR
  $menu = Tickit::Widget::Menu->new( %args )
    Constructs a new `Tickit::Widget::Menu' object.

    Takes the following named arguments:

    name => STRING
            Optional. If present, gives the name of the menu item for a
            submenu. Not used in a top-level menu.

    items => ARRAY
            Optional. If present, contains a list of
            `Tickit::Widget::Menu::Item' or `Tickit::Widget::Menu' objects
            to add to the menu. Equivalent to psasing each to the
            `push_item' method after construction.

METHODS
  $name = $menu->name
    Returns the string name for the menu.

  @items = $menu->items
    Returns the list of items currently stored.

  $menu->push_item( $item )
    Adds another item.

  $menu->popup( $win, $line, $col )
    Makes the menu appear at the given position relative to the given
    window. Note that as `$win->make_popup' is called, the menu is always
    displayed in a popup window, floating over the root window. Passed
    window is used simply as the origin for the given line and column
    position.

  $menu->dismiss
    Hides a menu previously displayed using `popup'.
